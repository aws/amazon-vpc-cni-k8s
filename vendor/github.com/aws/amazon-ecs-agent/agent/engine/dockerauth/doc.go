Package dockerauth handles storing auth configuration information for Docker
registries.

Usage

This package pulls authentication information from the passed configuration.
A user should set the "EngineAuthType" and "EngineAuthData" configuration
keys to values indicated below.

These keys may be set by either setting the environment variables
"ECS_ENGINE_AUTH_TYPE" and "ECS_ENGINE_AUTH_DATA" or by setting the keys "EngineAuthData" and "EngineAuthType" in the JSON configuration file located at the configured "ECS_AGENT_CONFIG_FILE_PATH" (see http://godoc.org/github.com/aws/amazon-ecs-agent/agent/config)

Auth Types

The two currently supported auth types are "docker" and "dockercfg".

Docker:

The auth type "docker" is intended to work most naturally with a JSON
configuration file. The "AuthData" is a structured JSON object which specifies
values for the docker "AuthConfig" structure. The "AuthData" should be an object
similar to the following:
	{
		"my.registry.example.com": {
			"username": "myUsername",
			"password": "myPassword"
		},
		"https://index.docker.io/v1/user": {
			"username": "my-dockerhub-username",
			"password": "my-dockerhub-password",
			"email": "my-optinallyincluded-email"
		}
	}


Dockercfg:

The auth type "dockercfg" is intended to allow easy use of an existing
".dockercfg" file generated by running "docker login". This auth type expects
the "AuthData" to be a string containing the contents of that file. The contents
of your ".dockercfg" will generally be a string of the following form:
	'{"http://myregistry.com/v1/":{"auth":"dXNlcjpzd29yZGZpc2g=","email":"email"}}'
