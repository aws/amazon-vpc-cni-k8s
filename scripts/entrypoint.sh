# NOTE(jaypipes): Normally, we would prefer *not* to have an entrypoint script
# and instead just start the agent daemon as the container's CMD. However, the
# design of CNI is such that Kubelet looks for the presence of binaries and CNI
# configuration files in specific directories, and the presence of those files
# is the trigger to Kubelet that that particular CNI plugin is "ready".
#
# In the case of the AWS VPC CNI plugin, we have two components to the plugin.
# The first component is the actual CNI binary that is execve'd from Kubelet
# when a container is started or destroyed. The second component is the
# aws-k8s-agent daemon which houses the IPAM controller.
#
# As mentioned above, Kubelet considers a CNI plugin "ready" when it sees the
# binary and configuration file for the plugin in a well-known directory. For
# the AWS VPC CNI plugin binary, we only want to copy the CNI plugin binary
# into that well-known directory AFTER we have succeessfully started the IPAM
# daemon and know that it can connect to Kubernetes and the local EC2 metadata
# service. This is why this entrypoint script exists; we start the IPAM daemon
# and wait until we know it is up and running successfully before copying the
# CNI plugin binary and its configuration file to the well-known directory that
# Kubelet looks in.
