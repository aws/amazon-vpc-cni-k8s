# amazon-vpc-cni-k8s
Networking plugin for pod networking in [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) using [Elastic Network Interfaces](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-eni.html) on AWS.

## Why this Fork

The plugin sets up iptable SNAT rules to change any outside VPC traffic to use the Primary IP address on the Primary ENI. This is non-configurable. Unfortunately, this broke routing in our clusters that are VPC peered. We've just manually configured the iptables rule to not just include the VPC cidr that the pod is in, but the entire 10.0.0.0/8 block (which all of our VPCs are in) as a workaround.

## Status

**Alpha**  This is an experimental release as part of the [Amazon EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) Preview.
Interfaces and functionality may change. Expect bugs (and please help us squash them).
DO NOT use for production workloads. 

## Installing

```
REPO_PATH=<path-to-this-repo>
kubectl apply -f $REPO_PATH/misc/aws-k8s-cni.yaml
```

## Components

  There are 2 components:
  
  * [CNI Plugin](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/network-plugins/#cni), which will wire up host's and pod's network stack when called.
  * L-IPAM, which is a long running node-Local IP Address Management (IPAM) daemon, is responsible for:
  	* maintaining a warm-pool of available IP addresses, and
  	* assigning an IP address to a Pod.

The details can be found in [Proposal: CNI plugin for Kubernetes networking over AWS VPC](https://github.com/aws/amazon-vpc-cni-k8s/blob/master/proposals/cni-proposal.md)
   
## Requirements

* kubelets must be started with --network-plugin=cni and have --cni-conf-dir and --cni-bin-dir properly set. 
	* In aws-k8s-cni.yaml, the following defaults are configured:
		*  --cni-conf-dir=/etc/cni/net.d
		*  --cni-bin-dir=/opt/cni/bin

* kubeletes must also explicit specify using primary IPv4 address on the Primary ENI as its node-ip, for example:
 `--node-ip=$(curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/local-ipv4)`

* L-IPAM requires following [IAM policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html):
